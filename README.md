# Facebook-AI-Hackathon

An image processing artifical intelligence PyTorch project to detect relevant ads for appropriate Facebook groups.
A request is sent to group admins for these ads to be posted to maintain a spam free platform.

Implements the Google Cloud Vision API and Facebook Groups API.

Currently under development. Will be updated by the end of the hackathon in March 2020.
